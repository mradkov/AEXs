## Simple Summary

Suggests the addition of referral mechanism over smart contracts, storing account information. For example decentralized applications.

## Abstract

Almost every platform/project/game/service on the web has some kind of referral mechanism used for marketing purposes, but not only. We believe that for a smooth transition from the current centralized internet model to a decentralized one, the users should have at least the same user experience or better. With this proposal we want to standardize a referral mechanism for Aeternity smart contracts that can be used for all sorts of bounty campaigns and reward systems for both tokens and AE.

## Motivation

This AEX is motivated by the need for onchain tracking of referred user accounts on some decentralized applications. On-chain saving the referrals will be able to verify information about a given address from a single trusted source without concerning that it could be manipulated, and to do so in as simple manner as possible. It is also motivated by the desire to make user experience with decentralized applications more flawles and user-friendly by both the simplicity of the interface as well as by the guarantees on uniqueness provided by the proposed standard.

This AEX proposes a light-weight interface for adding referrals functionality for smart contracts. This abstraction layer can sit on top of standards for fungible tokens and later for non-funbible tokens as well. Or any other smart contract use-case that requires referals logic.
